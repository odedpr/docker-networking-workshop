What is routing?
Routing is a means of sending an IP packet from one point to another.
  
* All network devices, whether they are hosts, routers, or other types of network nodes such as network attached printers, need to make decisions about where to route TCP/IP data packets.  
* The routing table provides the configuration information required to make those decisions
