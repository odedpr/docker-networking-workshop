####The Linux Bridge
A Linux bridge is a Layer 2 device that is the virtual implementation of a physical switch inside the Linux kernel.
It forwards traffic based on MAC addresses which it learns dynamically by inspecting traffic. 
Linux bridges are used extensively in many of the Docker network drivers. 


The Spanning Tree Protocol (STP) is a network protocol that builds a logical loop-free topology for Ethernet networks. 
The basic function of STP is to prevent bridge loops and the broadcast radiation that results from them
