### Workshop Descriptions

Docker has revolutionized virtualization by abstarcting some ~15 years old Kernel tools, 
allowing developers, system admins and Devops to easily package and deliver application-in-containers 
without worring about the underlying infrastructure and application dependencies when moving from one environment to another.  

Along the way they have been using some basic linux netowrking tools ( and now windows ) that enabled container netowrking.

This workshop will intreduce general netowrking concepts, tools and docker specific netowrking model and its implementation.

### Participants Will

1. Understand basic networking concepts by using various tools such as tcpdump, ip command etc.
2. Understand the CNM ( container networking model ).
3. Understand single host container networking ( bridge driver ) and multi-host container networking ( overlay driver )
