### networking models

* Whether itâ€™s wired or wireless, most data communications today happens by way of packets of information travelling over one or more networks. 
* But before these networks can work together, though, they must use a common protocol, or a set of rules for transmitting and receiving these packets of data. 
* One of the most widely used protocol is the `Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol (TCP/IP)`. 
* Also, a generic protocol model used in describing network communications known as the `Open System Interconnection (OSI)` model is useful for comparing and contrasting different protocols

#### OSI model
* The OSI model is a standard of the International Organization for Standardization (ISO). 
* It is a general-purpose paradigm for discussing or describing how computers communicate with one another over a network. 
* Its seven-layered approach to data transmission divides the many operations up into specific related groups of actions at each layer.
